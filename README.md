# FlameGuard - Forest Fire Prediction

FlameGuard is a predictive machine learning model designed to forecast forest fires based on various environmental factors. By analyzing data like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and moisture indices, FlameGuard aims to mitigate the risks and impacts of forest fires, providing early warnings to enable faster and more efficient interventions. This project leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to help safeguard ecosystems, wildlife, and human communities from the devastating effects of forest fires.

## Techwiz 5 Global Competition

FlameGuard is being developed as part of the global competition **Techwiz 5**, where teams from around the world compete to create innovative technological solutions to pressing real-world problems. Our team, **MSG HASH**, is proudly participating in this competition from the platform of **Aptech MSG**. The project aims to showcase our expertise in machine learning and predictive analytics by addressing the critical issue of forest fire prediction. Through FlameGuard, we hope to contribute to environmental conservation by leveraging cutting-edge technology to predict and mitigate the risk of forest fires.

## Project Overview

Forest fires are a growing environmental concern, worsened by climate change and human activities. FlameGuard addresses this issue by predicting the likelihood of forest fires, helping prevent potential disasters. By combining weather patterns, historical fire occurrences, and vegetation data, FlameGuard enables forest stations to respond quickly and mitigate the impact of fires.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available at [Kaggle - Forest Fires Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elikplim/forest-fires-data-set). It consists of 515 instances with variables such as:

- **Month**: Month of the year
- **Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC)**: Moisture content of surface litter
- **Duff Moisture Code (DMC)**: Moisture content of loosely compacted organic layers
- **Drought Code (DC)**: Moisture content of deep organic layers
- **Initial Spread Index (ISI)**: Spread rate of a fire
- **Temperature**: In degrees Celsius
- **Relative Humidity (RH)**: In percentage
- **Wind Speed**: In km/h
- **Class**: The presence (1) or absence (0) of fire

The data focuses on the northeast region of Portugal and is divided into training, generalization, and testing subsets.
